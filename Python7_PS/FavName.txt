FavName by Shel Silverstein

FavName loves me,
FavName cares,
FavName picks me peaches and pears.
FavName offers me candy and Cokes,
FavName listens and laughs at me jokes.
FavName helps when I get in a fight,
FavName does all my homework at night.
FavName misses me,
FavName cries,
FavName thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that FavName is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and FavName just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for FavName's hand,
In the darkness where FavName usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
FavName's gone!
